Time series forecasting uses historical data to predict future values. It relies on analyzing trends, seasonality, and autocorrelations in the data. Common methods include autoregressive models like ARIMA that use lagged values as predictors, exponential smoothing models like Holt-Winters that weight recent observations more, and machine learning techniques like recurrent neural networks. The goal is to accurately forecast future points by fitting mathematical models. Time series forecasting has applications in economics, finance and traffic.

The structure consists of a region network generation layer, $L$ spatial-temporal layers, and an output layer. We calculate POI's IIF modeling to obtain functional similarity matrix and use the spectral cluster method for functional region division, capturing hierarchical geographical traffic network relationships. Each layer has node-level and region-level ST blocks to extract features, with POI-based dynamic GCN in node-level ST block handling spatial correlations and spatial attention GCN in region-level ST block capturing spatial traffic features.
